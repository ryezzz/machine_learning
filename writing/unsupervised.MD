**Unsupervised Machine Learning for Degenerative Dementia**

Alzheimer's and other forms of terminal dementia are massive, global problems with no treatments proven to delay disease progression. My concept is that the only implementable way to immediately help people with terminal dementia is to change their relationship to the world around them by prolonging their independence. Unsupervised machine learning could help with this by analyzing a person's unique behavioral changes and offering the exact level of assistance that a person requires as their disease progresses.

Machine learning has been proven effective for the [diagnosis of Alzheimers by behavioral and population clustering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959357/), but I'm imagining applying it as a daily measure of disease progression that responds by offering a form of caregiving assistance.

This idea could be implemented as an audio application in a wearable device such as an apple watch. Daily questions for the patient could collect text data that would then be clustered, analyzed and compared over time to determine how a patient's disease is progressing.

This application would essentially create a behavioral, mood, and language structure clustering pattern for an individual in the early stage of the disease, analyze changes in those clusters over time, and respond by offering different levels of audio-based caregiving.

In Terms of implementation this would need to be an audio app because people with Alzheimer's lose reading comprehension before speaking comprehension. It would be a supplemental form of caregiving offering comfort and monitoring when a caregiver is away: reminders of past experiences, checking in with emotional status of patient and contacting caregivers based on unexpected changes in movement, location or breathing patterns.
