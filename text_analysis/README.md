# Predicting helpful amazon reviews through text analysis.

[For this project](https://github.com/visualizedata/ml/tree/master/week06) I focused on feature analysis to predict the helpfulness of Amazon data, including: explanation points, starting sentence with "I", and user identification.

I sent my features through a [scikit learn Multinomial Naive bayes algorithm  ](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html) to achieve decent prediction accuracy:
